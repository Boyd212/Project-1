# Challenge 1 - Accessability
  
  DISCLAIMER:  I had a particularly in regards to GitHub, as you can see in my repository.  Its a mess.  I will continue to build and grow on the challenges I faced attempting to complete this project.  I had issues with the coding working in VS Code, then after a push into the repo, the code would break, amongst other issues.  In the interest of needing to turn this project in on time, I have to go with what I have and include as much I am able to.
